# Bitcoin-Tracker
A GUI that shows a live graph of the price of Bitcoin, made with Tkinter in Python.

The application uses live API data coming from 4 different crypto exchanges; Bitfinex, Huobi, Wex and Bitstamp. 

The data is pulled and parsed using Json and Pandas, then graphed using Matplotlib. 

All of this is made inside of Tkinter and the graph updates completely live.

I also added a candle graph which isn't currently finished however is fully functional. 

This project is not complete but it was a great learning experience and fun little project.
